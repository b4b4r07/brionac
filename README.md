# :dragon: Brionac

A simple alternative means of the Brewfile

## Description

One day, `brew bundle` is deprecated.

> [What? “Warning: brew bundle is unsupported …” #30815](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/issues/30815)

Having said that, we want to manage in the Brewfile. Although there are some alternative means, they are too multi-functional to deal with "formula" installation easily. We just want to simplify the installation using the Brewfile. Then, it is :dragon: *Brionac* !!.

Brionac will only install the formula described in the `formula.yaml`. Strictly speaking, Brionac synchronize formulas to `formula.yaml`. Also, Brionac will uninstall the formula that are installed without being described in `formula.yaml`

***DEMO:***

## Features

- Install the formula described in `formula.yaml`
- Uninstall the formula that are installed without being described in `formula.yaml`

## Requirements

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)

## Usage

```bash
$ brionac attack
```

If no arguments are given, Brionac will synchronise based on the `formula.yaml`.

For more information, see `brionac help`
